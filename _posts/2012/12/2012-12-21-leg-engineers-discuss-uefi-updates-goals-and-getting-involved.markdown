A UEFI Mini-Sprint was held at the Linaro offices in Cambridge UK on 11-13 December.

[Rony Nandy](http://www.linaro.org/linux-on-arm/meet-the-team/rony-nandy/), Enterprise Server Engineer for the [Linaro Enterprise Group](http://www.linaro.org/engineering/leg) (LEG) summed up the Sprint in a [blog post this week](http://www.linaro.org/2012/12/19/uefi-mini-sprint-at-cambridge-from-11-13-dec-2012/). Nandy writes in his post that during the this mini-sprint problems such as a location for all the board support for edk2(UEFI) on ARM were fixed.  The maintainer-ship structure for UEFI on ARM was also discussed and goals for UEFI on ARM in 2013 were put in motion.

LEG Engineers held [a public Hangout on Air](http://youtu.be/hSnXW3DjQ4I) where they discussed UEFI updates, future goals and how to get involved.



Participants for this hangout included [Andrea Gallo](http://www.linaro.org/linux-on-arm/meet-the-team/andrea-gallo/), Director of LEG who opened the Hangout and facilitated the discussion. [David Rusling](http://www.linaro.org/linux-on-arm/meet-the-team/david-a-rusling/), Linaro, CTO gave feedback and [Grant Likely](http://www.linaro.org/linux-on-arm/meet-the-team/grant-likely/), Technical Architect discussed the various goals that were achieved at the mini-sprint.

Engineers from and ARM and Linaro had the opportunity to add their thoughts and insights to the discussion. From ARM were Leif Lindholm  and Olivier Martin with [Ryan Harkin](http://www.linaro.org/linux-on-arm/meet-the-team/ryan-harkin/), Tech Lead for the ARM Landing Team and  [Anmar Oueja](http://www.linaro.org/linux-on-arm/meet-the-team/anmar-oueja/), Technical Program Manager from Linaro rounding out the Hangout.

The formation of LEG was [announced](http://www.linaro.org/news/industry-leaders-collaborate-to-accelerate-software-ecosystem-for-arm-servers-and-join-linaro/en/) in early November.  As part of the announcement initial work and goals were outlined.  "Linaro expects initial software delivery before the end of 2012 with ongoing releases thereafter," and yesterday [LEG announced](http://www.linaro.org/2012/12/20/linaro-enterprise-group-leg-releases-its-12-12-engineering-preview/) it meet that goal and released its [Engineering Preview](https://wiki.linaro.org/LEG/Engineering/Releases/12.12).

UEFI is only one [part of the roadmap](https://wiki.linaro.org/LEG#Scope_of_Work) that [LEG](http://www.linaro.org/engineering/leg) will be working on in 2013.
