The Thursday keynote was given by Brian Richardson who is an an Intel technical evangelist and is a blogger for the Intel Software Evangelists project, a former writer for linux.com, and executive producer for DragonConTV.  Brian gave a keynote on "[TianoCore - Open Source UEFI Community Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ5X8vqdSu0)".  Brian spoke about the TianoCore project which hosts EDK II, an open source implementation of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).   He discussed how EDK II has become the defacto UEFI implementation for ARM and Intel platforms, expanding standards based firmware across multiple architectures.  He gave an update on the current status of the TianoCore project, plans for future improvements, and talked about why firmware is critical in today’s digital ecosystem.

Thursday night was our Linaro Connect party for all the attendees.  There was great food and drinks as well as lots of games for people to try out.  The party was Vegas themed and we had many people "dress up" for the event and take advantage of our photo booth to capture some team fun.  These are some of our favorites.
