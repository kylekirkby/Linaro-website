It began with a [Welcome Keynote](http://connect.linaro.org/resource/las16/las16-100k1/) by Linaro’s CEO, George Grey, who welcomed attendees to the event and gave an overview of the many projects that Linaro is working on with its member companies.  George then went on to demo several of these projects.

Every device being connected to the cloud and generating personal information is a huge data generation, connectivity and security headache. Standards are essential to the success of IoT and the LITE group will[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_video link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnQZiXpN3cQ"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]bring together ARM ecosystem support for key standards and engineering work to support reliable implementations.  LITE will benefit from Linaro’s other engineering activities in the same way as the other groups.  LITE will also leverage Linaro’s work on security and trusted execution environments, cloud integration and existing embedded Linux activities and it will work closely with other segment groups, including Linaro’s enterprise group, which has expertise in and around the data center and Linaro’s network group, which has expertise in real time.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]After George’s keynote, Morgan Quigley, Chief Architect of the Open Source Robotics Foundation, the gave a second keynote on “The Robot Operating System: An Open Source Framework for Modern Robotics”.  Morgan discussed the many challenges in trying to create robust, general-purpose robot software.  He went on to talk about how even trivial talks to humans can be very difficult for robots to perform due to so many variables involved.   Due to all this complexity the Robot Operating system (ROS) was born to help encourage collaborative software efforts.   He went on to talk about the design of ROS and show a collection of applications in industry, academia, and government and briefly described current development efforts to incorporate Transport Layer Security (TLS), access controls, a flexible UDP-based networking subsystem, and other “wish list” items for the future.  [Watch keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCLFp55y0dc)[/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row]
