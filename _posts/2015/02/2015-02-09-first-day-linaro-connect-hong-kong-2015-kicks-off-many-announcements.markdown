**If you missed the first day of Linaro Connect Hong Kong 2015 (HKG15) you missed a lot.  **




The show kicked off Monday February 9th in Hong Kong to many announces by Linaro.  George Grey, Linaro's CEO, gave the opening keynote and welcomed attendees to the event.  He then announced the [96Boards initiative ](http://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-announces-96boards-initiative-accelerate-arm-software-development/)to accelerate ARM software development.  [96Boards](https://www.96boards.org/) is an open hardware specification for ARM 32-bit and 64-bit developer boards, and a Community Program for software delivery to developers, makers and OEMs.  Linaro also announced on Monday two founding members of the newly formed Linaro Community Boards Group (LCG), which are [Actions Technology](http://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-announces-actions-technology-founding-member-linaro-community-boards-group/) and [Marvell](http://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-announces-marvell-founding-member-linaro-community-boards-group/).
