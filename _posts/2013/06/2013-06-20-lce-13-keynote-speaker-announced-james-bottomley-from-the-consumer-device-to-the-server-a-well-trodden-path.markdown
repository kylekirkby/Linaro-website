We’re excited to announce that James Bottomley, will be giving the Monday, July 8th keynote at [Linaro Connect Europe 2013](http://www.linaro.org/connect) (LCE-13).




James Bottomley is CTO of Server Virtualisation at [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/about/about-parallels/) with a current focus on Open Source container technologies and Linux Kernel maintainer of the SCSI subsystem, PA-RISC Linux and the 53c700 set of drivers. He has made contributions in the areas of x86 architecture and SMP, filesystems, storage and memory management and coherency.  He is currently a Director on the Board of the Linux Foundation and Chair of its Technical Advisory Board. He was born and grew up in the United Kingdom. He went to university at Cambridge in 1985 for both his undergraduate and doctoral degrees. He joined AT&T Bell labs in 1995 to work on Distributed Lock Manager technology for clustering. In 1997 he moved to the LifeKeeper High Availability project. In 2000 he helped found SteelEye Technology, Inc as Software Architect and later as Vice President and CTO.  He joined Novell in 2008 as a Distinguished Engineer at Novell's SUSE Labs and Parallels in 2011.




James' keynote is titled '[From the consumer device to the server: A well trodden path?](Monday Keynote: James Bottomley)' is based on the following abstract:




At the dawn of the UNIX epoch (well, in the seventies, anyway) it was a well known fact that processor architectures (which should be many and risc) had to be designed specifically for the enterprise server.  Each different architecture filled a slightly different niche in the diverse enterprise.  In the early nineties, that vision was gone, UNIX was dying and the humble desktop x86 processor and its allied server operating system Windows NT were poised to sweep away old UNIX and conquer the enterprise on the crest of the Wintel duopoly wave.  Today the enterprise is won, the marketing guys quietly changed the first letter of the sign from W to L and the jilted W went off to sulk in the Rainforests of the Pacific Northwest interrupted only by a series of failed business plans and the odd bout of chair throwing.




What this shows, of course, is that even for an incredibly well funded assault on the bastions of enterprise servers, the road from desktop to server was anything but smooth.  This talk will review history, what went well and what didn't, why UNIX really died, the 64 bit boulder, the hypervisor extensions and so on, drawing parallels with the progress of ARM today and illuminating some potholes in its road to the server.




We'll also look at the evolving nature of the server and the modern data centre and what changes this might force in processor architectures and explain why the solution to power budgets and green computing might not necessarily be the magic bullet with ARMs name on it.
