[Linaro Connect Asia 2014](http://www.linaro.org/connect-lca14) promises to be the largest Connect to date (again).  As always, there will be a few surprises during the week including one that may make you think about “Home” while enjoying the pleasures of [one of the world’s richest cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau).




There will be [keynote sessions](http://www.linaro.org/connect-lca14/schedule/keynote-speakers-at-lca14) each of the five days with topics ranging from the state of [![LCE13 Opening Keynote](http://www.linaro.org/linaro-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LCE13-Opening-Keynote-150x150.jpg)](http://www.linaro.org/linaro-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LCE13-Opening-Keynote.jpg)ARM Servers and Software Defined Networking to open source development for carrier class equipment.  And, of course, a look into the future with David Rusling (Linaro, CTO). What are the extents of David’s vision?  Stay through Friday and you may find out!




ARMv8 will be a key theme of the week.  ARMv8 SoC’s and platforms are here and more are coming this year.  Software development for ARMv8 has been ongoing for many months and a tipping point has been reached when hardware and software combine to accelerate market adoption of this largest generation of the ARM architecture.  Expect ARMv8 to be front and center in many of the sessions this week.




Monday through Wednesday are filled with [sessions](http://lca-14.zerista.com/) from the working groups, engineering teams and segment groups.  Topic areas include the ARMv8 kernel, Energy-efficient Scheduler, big.LITTLE GTS, Android, ARM Trusted Firmware, 64-bit GNU and LLVM toolchains, UEFI secure boot, ACPI, OpenDataPlane (ODP), VM Standards, LSK and LAVA / CI Loops.  The afternoons will allow time for the teams to work together in hacking rooms.




[![W2_shovan-03](http://www.linaro.org/linaro-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/W2_shovan-03-150x150.png)](http://www.linaro.org/linaro-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/W2_shovan-03.png)On Wednesday night, suspend disbelief for an evening of Bond, James Bond..... Think ‘Casino Royale’ ([1] not [2]) for this Bond themed [gala dinner](http://www.linaro.org/connect-lca14/socializing/gala-dinner). There will be prizes for the best dressed male and female characters, best accessory and luckiest guest of the night!  Rumor has it that Jon Masters is in line to be the next James Bond.  However, this seems unlikely given his fascination with world domination and fluffy white cats.




Thursday is ‘Team Day’ and is jammed packed with sessions from start to finish.  The sessions include some topic areas not covered earlier in the week such as Testing a secure framework, GPGPU, Big Endian, Chromium optimization and profiling.  In addition, there will be hacking all day in each of the team hacking rooms.  What to do?   You can’t do it all so you will have to choose...choose wisely :)




Believe it or not, there are even more sessions on Friday!   Why?  Because there is so much to talk about it wasn’t possible to fit all the session into 4 days even with all day sessions on Thursday.  However, end we must so after the morning sessions there will be rapid summaries (back by popular demand after the inaugural appearance at LCU-13).  Can anyone top Tom Gall’s memorable performance at LCU-13?  Following the rapid summaries will be annual awards for some over achievers who went above and beyond in 2013.




The Technology Showcase caps the week with demonstrations on a variety of accomplishments over the past several months.  Food and drink will be served to soothe the weary and encourage stimulating conversation.


Expect the unexpected and enjoy the week!

_P.S.   A note of caution in Macau, gambling may be hazardous to your wealth.
Friends don’t let friends go home empty. :)_
